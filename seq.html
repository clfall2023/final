            <h2> ALBUM SEQUENCING </h2>
        <p> While some albums can be played on shuffle and the experience would not change, if you would want to leave an impression on your audience, you would need to make the tracklist flow in a natural way or else your album would go out of style quickly </p>
            <h3> THE BEGINNING </h3>
            <p> An opening track should hook the listener in and give them just a sample of what the rest of the album has musically, which makes the listener want to listen to the rest of the album. <br><br> Do not put the best song as the opening track. Under no circumstance, would anyone need to make the best song the first track that the listener would hear. Sure, it might be a great opening track, but the rest of the album would be downhill from that point. If the best song is the first song everyone would hear when they turn on the album, then the chances of them replaying that song would increase and the rest of the album would not get any attention. <br><br> A good intro track doesn't need to be labeled as such, nor does it need to be a throwaway song, remember, this is supposed to make the listener want to listen to the rest of the album. A good opening song depends on the genre, but a good "sample" song would be best. A song that is a good representation of the album's sound as a whole is a worthy contender for an opener. <br><br> </p>

                <p> A bad opening song would contain none of any of the points just made. A song like "Feel the Same" by Sunsleeper would be considered a weak opening track, since it is a short acoustic guitar driven ballad on a pop rock album that feels out of place with the rest of the songs.
            </p>
            <h3> THE MIDDLE </h3>
            <p> You can grab the listener's attention, but can you hold it? The middle of the album is most-often how people separate the good albums from the great ones, because of the pacing. <br><br>Pacing is key when determining what songs go where in the middle. The middle section of an album should not go on a decline in quality in any aspect of the songs. If there are songs that are so-so and you are determined to release them, sprinkle them in between the really great songs, although it is not advised to keep them at all. </p>
                <img src="GFT.png" height="200" width="303" alt="Good Faith Tracklist">
                <p> Oftentimes, albums don't go from an upbeat song to a chill one back-to-back, so it is best to have a transition in between. It could be separate songs, or an extended instrumental at the end. Madeon's album Good Faith (2019) connects the two songs "Mania" and "Miracle" by a soft piano solo at the very end of "Mania" that is in the key of "Miracle" to prepare the listener for the centerpiece of the album.</p>
            <img src="CDT.png" height="192" width="330" alt="Come Down Tracklist">
            <p>The band Pretty Sick did something similar on their album Come Down (2021) as the song "Self Control" has raging guitar riffs and the vocalist delivering the chorus with angst, as the song comes to a slow end with extended guitar feedback at the end that directly and smoothly transitions into "Pillbug", making way for a more reverb-drenched and downtempo sound of the album.</p>
            <h3> THE END </h3>
            <p> What happens when the listener has reached the end? What are they going to walk away with when the album ends? A good final song should leave the listener with something that they can't get out of their heads, that makes them want to listen to it again. <br><br>The final song could be a slow instrumental or ballad that overstays its welcome, or it could be something that the listener can come back to and find value in it just as much as they do with the rest of the album. <br><br>Generally, the more creative the closing track is, the more it will stick with listeners. </p>

            <p>Ruby Empress's album Sinbolism (2019) has a woman with a heavy accent talking about the seasons of the year and comparing them to colors as the vocal melody for a previous song on the album, "Armour" is being played in the background. </p>

<p>Fang Island's debut album, Fang Island (2010), starts off with numerous explosions scattered throughout the intro track, and the very same noises can be heard in the final song, "Dorian".</p>

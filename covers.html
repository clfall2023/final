            <h2> an album about loving yourself because we kind all need to do that. </h2>
        <p>ily (in all lowercase, pronounced 'I. L. Y.') is my debut studio album released October 22, 2021.</p>

            <p>  The majority of the album was made over the course of a single week during spring break in my senior year of high school. I held onto the album and tweaked it a couple of times in order to have it release in my first semester of college. </p>

                <h3> Track-by-track </h3>
                <ul>
		<li>Maybe I Am Okay is the opening track that takes a while to get going. It's a slow introduction into the album and has a massive payoff at the end.</li>
		<li>Smoke Up is about peer pressure getting to you and wanting a means to escape it. Also has a bonus surprise in the middle.</li>
		<li>Fell Apart is a song about reflection, about wanting change. One of the very short songs to break up the tracklist.</li>
		<li>Carly is what one of my friends called me for the longest time because to them it was the genderbent version of my name. Also has a fun synth solo at the end.</li>
		<li>I don't want you here is about not feeling happy with yourself and desperately wanting to be someone else and also the centerpiece of the album.</li>
		<li>wait nvm is what I told myself when it was all over.</li>
		<li>New Shorts is about getting a new pair of clothes. Finding happiness in the little things in life and knowing there's brighter days ahead.</li>
		<li>You're Beautiful To Me is what I told myself when I realised my true self worth. A purely happy song that belongs towards the end of the album.</li>
		<li>I Love You is not a title track, but the longest one on here including a medley of previous songs. A perfect ending.</li>

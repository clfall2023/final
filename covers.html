            <h2> ALBUM COVERS </h2>
        <p>What makes a good album cover? How do you feel when you look at the cover for Darkside by Winters of Blue (2022)? Or Moenie and Kitchi by Gregory and the Hawk (2008)? Even if the music isn't critically received, the cover is the very first impression everyone would have when they first encounter your album.</p>

            </div>
            <p> Even before the internet was invented, the album cover is practically the only visual element associated with the album at all. So how do you hook the listener with a good album cover? </p> 
            <h3> COLOR </h3>
            <p>What color does your album sound like? Internet Breath by the band Hey, Ily (2021) has pastel pink, purple and white all over the cover to symbolize the cheery and happy sounding instrumentals intended to give a childlike feeling. The cover also has pixel art of a figure playing a guitar to represent the chiptune and vocal processing throughout the entire project. </p>

                <p>Album covers that feature the artist in creative ways, host unusual subjects, or a mix of the two can also be eyegrabbing to the listener. </p>
                <h3> OBJECTS </h3>
                <p>The band The Happy Fits have an ongoing trend of putting fruit on their album covers in different backdrops in different scenarios that match the specific album's sound. They started with a banana as a play-on-words for their debut EP Awfully Apeelin' (2016), then an orange plugged into an audio amplifier for Concentrate (2018), then What Could Be Better (2020) featured a grapefruit in place of a vinyl record on a Fisher Price record player, and their latest release, Under the Shade of Green (2022) also hosted a pineapple coated in dollar bills on fire. Consistency is key if you want fans to recognise an album cover as yours just by a first glance. </p>

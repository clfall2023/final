            <h2> I like High Guardian Spice so much I made an album about it. </h2>
        <p>The Diamond Queen is my second studio album released January 10, 2023.</p>

            <p>  High Guardian Spice is a cartoon that got a horrible reception from viewers for many different reasons, but I, however, enjoyed the show quite a bit. During 2022, I found myself writing a bunch of songs that involved the characters so I might as well make a full album about it. </p>

                <h3> Track-by-track </h3>
                <ul>
		<li>lyngarth national anthem is a great national anthem for any country, since not many of them have an EDM bass drop.</li>
		<li>PARSLEY EVERYWHERE is about the character from the show, named Parlsey, being everywhere on everyone's "HGS characters that are actually good" lists.</li>
		<li>Caraway, Away! is about Professor Caraway. I haven't heard any love songs about a non-binary person, so I wanted to make one.</li>
		<li>Elf Girl is about the elf girl in the show speaking to her mom in order to complete her character arc and goal in the show.</li>
		<li>Slab & the Dumb Hats is about the witch in the show, Sage, being unable to decide which giant hat to wear.</li>
		<li>AMARYLLIS is instrumental because I would believe if the character made an EDM song, it would be nothing but curse words that would have to be censored.</li>
		<li>rosemary is the first song I made for this album. A sharp contrast from the bubbly and energetic character in the show, however.</li>
		<li>OLIVE is a villain in the show with good intentions that happened to end up on the wrong path in life and this song is her narrating her regret.</li>
		<li>aura is a personal favorite, and the only song not about the show. It doesn't go anywhere but has a good bassline, and a great separation between songs and those reasons are why its on here.</li>
		<li>Snapdragon is the character I relate to most in the show, and is being sung to instead of being the narrator. I wanted this song to be full of hope and brighter days ahead for the character.</li>

            <h2> MARKETING </h2>
            <p>You have your release ready to go, but are you just going to release it and leave it to rot on Bandcamp and YouTube? Absolutely not. <br><br>While those two websites are vital to get your name out there, perfect marketing comes from knowing your platform and audience. It is easy and free to get your music on any and all streaming platforms with services like Routenote and Amuse. First and foremost, get your music on all streaming platforms preferably the same day it releases on the aforementioned websites, which leads into the first point. <br><br>YouTube ads seem like a good idea, however, only buy an ad if you have a hefty amount of money to spare. YouTube charges money based on reach and not by length or the amount of time it runs on the platform. In the simplest of terms, the more people see your ad, the more money you spend as a result. <br><br>If you are on a strict and tight budget, there are many avenues you can take in order to get your name out there. Posting internet memes on platforms like Instagram and Twitter are only dependent on luck and nothing else, so it is very likely you will not get people to listen to your music by doing minimal effort. </p>
            
            <h3> HOW TO GET YOUR NAME OUT THERE</h3>

            <img class="float" src="CCPoster.jpg" alt="Poster" height="250" width="200">
            <p> One option you can take is designing an overall aesthetic to your album based on the cover and other aspects of the album. Download a free photo editing app (there are dozens on the App Store and Google Play) and make posters advertising your music. Once you have a design you're happy with, you can go to your public library and print them out for a small fee and hang them in busy spots all over your town or possibly other towns to expand your reach. </p>

            <p> If you are on a zero dollar budget, there are other ways to stand out that count as marketing. One noteworthy example is the electro-rock producer Ghost and Pals's only album, Thanks to You Songâ€¦ (2018) which is a condensed version of a YouTube comment posted to a video of theirs. The album was then later titled the full comment on Bandcamp, but streaming platforms use the shortened title. The cover has the screenshotted comment sloppily placed on the top and bottom with an illustration of the persona the producer uses in the center. If an album makes you want to drop everything and listen to it based on the title and cover alone, that is marketing being effective. <br><br>If you have managed to get your music on streaming platforms, there are first party services that are specifically designed to work to your advantage to set up good marketing. Almost every streaming platform uses one of your album covers as the default profile picture, but using free services like Spotify for Artists, allows you to set your own profile picture and profile banner, as well as numerous other ways to stand out. </p>

        <p>The "Artist Pick" feature puts one release, your own or someone else's, at the forefront of your page and is vital to making sure what you want your fans and first-timers to listen to when they go on your profile. </p>
            <img class="float" src="igpDesc.png" alt="Description for an artist" height="200" width="300">
            <p>You can also type out your own description at the bottom of your page with a gallery attached. There are many ways you can use this to your advantage, like list your accolades and tell your listeners about your music, or set your description as something nonsensical that barely has anything to do with the music. Many artists are now following the trend of having one-sentence descriptions on Spotify, and as much as that can help with listeners being curious about your music, impulsing them to listen to it out of pure curiosity, listing your inspirations, overall sound, and other subjects about yourself can also be very helpful in incentivising people to listen to your music.</p>
